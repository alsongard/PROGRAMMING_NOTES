WPA2 definition:
WiFi Protected Access (WPA) is a WiFi protocol that has better security mechanisms than protocols such as WEP by means of handling user authentication and keys more securely. WPA has been further improved by versions such as WPA2 and WPA3. 
WPA(2) uses a 4 way handshake. 
allows the client and the AP to both prove that they know the key, without telling each other. WPA and WPA2 use practically the same authentication method. 
PSK - Pre-shared key
