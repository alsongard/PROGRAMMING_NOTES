#### **Height and Width**
Setting h-screen and w-screen is the same as ``h-[100vh``] and ``w-[100vw]``.  Both achieve the same value.
However for mobile devices,`` h-[100vh``] may result in responsive defect and to fix this, it's recommended to use  **dynamic viewport height**. This is not supported in tailwindcss.
